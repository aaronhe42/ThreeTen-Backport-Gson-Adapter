ThreeTen Backport Gson Adapter
==============================

A library provides serialization/deserialization support for JSR-310 backport types using Gson. 

Currently supports `Instant`, `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, `LocalDateTime`, `OffsetDate`, `OffsetTime` and `ZonedDateTime`.

Usage
-----

Use one or some of static methods in `ThreeTenGsonAdapter` to register type adapter on `GsonBuilder` object.

For example, if you'd like `Gson` to serialize/deserialize `LocalTime`, register `LocalTime` using `ThreeTenGsonAdapter` like this:

````java
GsonBuilder builder = new GsonBuilder();
Gson gson = ThreeTenGsonAdapter.registerLocalTime(builder).create();
````

If you need all of the supported types, there's a convenient method: `ThreeTenGsonAdapter.registerAll()`.

Build
-----

To build:

````bash
$ git clone git@github.com:aaronhe42/ThreeTen-Backport-Gson-Adapter.git
$ cd ThreeTen-Backport-Gson-Adapter/
$ ./gradlew build
```

Download
--------

```groovy
compile 'org.aaronhe:threetenbp-gson-adapter:1.0.2'
```

Snapshots of the development version are available in [Sonatype's `snapshots` repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/).

If your project uses a library other than [threetenbp](https://github.com/ThreeTen/threetenbp) which actually provides the ThreeTen Backport, like [ThreeTenABP](https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP), you need to exclude threetenbp library from the dependency. Otherwise `UNEXPECTED TOP-LEVEL EXCEPTION: com.android.dex.DexException: Multiple dex files define Lorg/threeten/bp/Clock` will be thrown.

```groovy
compile('org.aaronhe:threetenbp-gson-adapter:1.0.2) {
  exclude module: 'threetenbp'
}
```

Or set `transitive` to `false`:

```groovy
compile('org.aaronhe:threetenbp-gson-adapter:1.0.2') {
  transitive = false
}
```
